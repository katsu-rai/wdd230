          This is the example of Hick’s Law. The website is designed to lead
          customers to make actions for either buy or learn more about the
          product. The website is very sophisticated.

        <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>The New York Times</p>

        </div>
        <p>
          This is the example of Visual Hierarchy. The company’s name is the
          biggest and hot news follow. As you scroll, you will see more news but
          they are displayed smaller compared to the hot news at the top. They
          change the size of font and image depending on how interesting they
          are to readers.

        </div>
        <p>
          This is the example of Rule of Thirds. The picture on the website is
          clearly designed based on the Rule of Thirds. If you draw the
          guidelines in your mind, you would know how well the website is
          organized.
